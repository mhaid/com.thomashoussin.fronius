# Fronius

Adds support for Fronius inverter. 

# Drivers
After installing the app, several possibilities are available : 
* Inverter : shows for every inverter PV power, daily/yearly/total Production, AC/DC current and AC/DC voltage. PV power is reported in energy tab
* Smartmeter : shows current, voltage, frequency, power and energy (produced/injected) for every smartmeter
* Ohmpilot : reports consumption and temperature for Ohmpilot consumption regulator 
* Storage : reports battery capacity, charged capacity, current and voltage
* PowerFlow : shows for the site PV, Grid, Load and Akku power. Load is reported in energy tab. 
* Reporting : using datamanager archive, adds a reporting app that shows costs, savings, self-consumption rate, etc.
